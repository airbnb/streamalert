Requirements
============

StreamAlert can accept ingest, analyze and alert on data from a wide range of environments and operating systems.

However, the StreamAlert application itself and its supporting services must be deployed in an `AWS <https://aws.amazon.com/>`_ account of your choosing.

Deployment is automated via `Terraform <https://www.terraform.io/>`_ and can be done against an existing account or an isolated account you’ve created for this purpose.
