Metrics
=======

StreamAlert enables `Enhanced Monitoring`_ to surface infrastructure metrics at a granular level.

.. _Enhanced Monitoring: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesis/latest/APIReference/API_EnableEnhancedMonitoring.html

Go to AWS Console -> CloudWatch -> Metrics -> Kinesis to view them.

Example metrics:

* IncomingBytes
* IncomingRecords
* Error/Exceptions

These metrics can be viewed at the shard-level or the stream-level (cluster/environment).

All of CloudWatch's features are at your disposal: graphing, dashboards, alerting, and more.

These metrics are useful for debugging, alerting on infrastructure metrics you care about, or for just getting a sense of the scale at which you're analyzing and alerting on data.


Custom Metrics
--------------

By default, StreamAlert will log various custom metrics to AWS CloudWatch via AWS CloudWatch Logs `Metric Filters <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/logs/MonitoringLogData.html>`_.

AWS CloudWatch Logs Metric Filters utilize `Filter Patterns <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/logs/FilterAndPatternSyntax.html>`_ to provide an extremely low-cost and highly scalable
approach to tracking custom metrics.

The decision to use Metric Filters vs `CloudWatch PutMetricData <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/APIReference/API_PutMetricData.html>`_ was made easy due to the
`limitations <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/cloudwatch_limits.html>`_ imposed by the PutMetricData API. StreamAlert has the potential to handle very
high throughput, so the posting of metrics needed to be able to keep pace. Metric Filter Patterns leverage the runtime's existing logger output in order to generate custom metrics
that can be graphed, use for alarms, etc.

StreamAlert logs custom metrics on the `cluster` level and also on the `aggregate` (aka: global) level. For example, a metric for `FailedParses` will be created for each individual cluster that is
configured. Along with publishing the metric to the respective cluster's metrics, the metric will also get published to the aggregate value for this metric. Think of the aggregate as a summation of a
metric across the entire StreamAlert deployment.

Custom metrics are logged to a unique `StreamAlert` namespace within CloudWatch Logs. Navigate to AWS Console -> CloudWatch -> Metrics -> StreamAlert to view these metrics.

Current Custom Metrics (found within ``stream_alert/shared/metrics.py``):

- FailedParses
- S3DownloadTime
- TotalProcessedSize
- TotalRecords
- TotalS3Records
- TotalStreamAlertAppRecords
- TriggeredAlerts
- FirehoseRecordsSent
- FirehoseFailedRecords


Toggling Custom Metrics
-----------------------

Logging of custom metrics will be enabled by default for the Lambda functions that support this feature.

To globally (for all clusters) disable custom metrics for the Rule Processor:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ python manage.py metrics --disable --functions rule


To disable custom metrics for the Rule Processor within specific cluster:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ python manage.py metrics --disable --functions rule --clusters <CLUSTER>


Swap the ``--disable`` flag for ``--enable`` in the above commands to have the inverse affect.



Alarms for Custom Metrics
-------------------------

With the addition of custom metrics comes the added bonus of CloudWatch alarms for custom metrics. StreamAlert's CLI can be used to add alarms on custom metrics as you see fit.

To get an up-to-date list of metrics alarms can be assign to, run:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ python manage.py create-alarm --help


The required arguments for the ``create-alarm`` subcommand mimic what is required by AWS CloudWatch's `PutMetricAlarm API <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/APIReference/API_PutMetricAlarm.html>`_.


Example Alarm (FailedParses)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: bash

  $ manage.py create-alarm \
  --metric FailedParses \
  --metric-target cluster \
  --comparison-operator GreaterThanOrEqualToThreshold \
  --alarm-name FailedParsesAlarm \
  --evaluation-periods 1 \
  --period 600 \
  --threshold 5.0 \
  --alarm-description 'Trigger this alarm if 5 or more failed parses occur within a 10 minute period in the cluster "prod"' \
  --clusters prod \
  --statistic Sum


Example Alarm (TotalRecords)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: bash

  $ manage.py create-alarm \
  --metric TotalRecords \
  --metric-target aggregate \
  --comparison-operator LessThanThreshold \
  --alarm-name MinimumTotalRecordsAlarm \
  --evaluation-periods 3 \
  --period 600 \
  --threshold 200000 \
  --alarm-description 'Trigger this alarm if the total incoming records (aggregate) drops below 200000 for 3 consecutive 10 minute time periods in a row' \
  --statistic Sum

The custom metric alarms will notify StreamAlert's default SNS topic for monitoring: ``stream_alert_monitoring``
