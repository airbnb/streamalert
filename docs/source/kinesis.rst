Kinesis Streams
===============

Overview
--------

* StreamAlert utilizes AWS Kinesis Streams for real-time data ingestion from `datasources <datasources.html>`_
* A Kinesis Stream is created for each `cluster <clusters.html>`_ you define.
* `Key concepts <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/streams/latest/dev/key-concepts.html>`_

At a high-level:

* A Kinesis Stream is created for each cluster you define
* A Kinesis Stream is composed of one or more shards
* The number of shards you choose is dependent on your data volume (see Concepts & Limits)
* Retention determines how long data is accessible on the stream itself; since StreamAlert is near real-time, the period can remain at the default of 24 hours
* Use Kinesis Firehose for retention of data for audit purposes or historical search

Limits
------

* `Kinesis Streams Limits`_
* `Kinesis Streams PUT Limits`_

.. _Kinesis Streams Limits: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/streams/latest/dev/service-sizes-and-limits.html
.. _Kinesis Streams PUT Limits: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesis/latest/APIReference/API_PutRecords.html

Fields
------

The following configuration settings are defined in each cluster file (``conf/clusters/cluster-name.json``)

Kinesis
~~~~~~~

Kinesis Streams settings for each cluster:

.. code-block:: json

  {
    "kinesis": {
      "streams": {
        "retention": 36,
        "shards": 5
      }
    }
  }

Options
~~~~~~~

=============  =========  ===========
Key            Required   Description
-------------  ---------  -----------
``retention``  ``true``   The data record retention period of your stream.
``shards``     ``true``   A shard provides a fixed unit of capacity to your stream.
=============  =========  ===========

Kinesis Firehose
================

Overview
--------

* StreamAlert supports using AWS Kinesis Firehose for storing incoming data into an S3 bucket; a separate S3 bucket is created for each `cluster <clusters.html>`_ you define
* This can be utilized for long-term persistence, an audit trail, or historical search (coming soon)
* Agents/code must be configured to send to both AWS Kinesis Streams and AWS Kinesis Firehose for long term storage

Limits
------

* `Kinesis Firehose Limits`_

.. _Kinesis Firehose Limits: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/firehose/latest/dev/limits.html

Fields
------

The following configuration settings are defined in each cluster file (``conf/clusters/cluster-name.json``)

Firehose
~~~~~~~~

Example:

.. code-block:: json

  {
    "kinesis": {
      "firehose": {
        "enabled": true,
        "s3_bucket_suffix": "streamalert.results"
      }
    }
  }

Options
~~~~~~~

====================  ========  ===========
Key                   Required  Description
--------------------  --------  -----------
``enabled``           ``true``  If set to ``false``, will not create a Kinesis Firehose
``s3_bucket_suffix``  ``true``  The suffix of the S3 bucket used for Kinesis Firehose data. The naming scheme is: ``prefix.cluster.suffix``
