Roadmap
=======

Large deliverables are outlined below. Progress, and smaller features, can be tracked on Github: https://github.com/airbnb/streamalert/issues

Crowdsource Plugin
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Target: Q1/Q2'17

The idea of crowdsourcing your alerts isn't new. Slack does this and the blog speaks at length to the benefits. In the near future, StreamAlert will support this use-case, allowing you to decentralize your triage efforts, getting alerts to those with the most context. Weâ€™re aiming for Q1/Q2'17.

Threat Intelligence
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Target: Q1/Q2'17

In the near future, StreamAlert will support comparing logs against traditional indicators of compromise (IOCs), which can range from thousands to millions in volume. This will be built in a way that's provider agnostic, allowing you to use ThreatStream, ThreatExchange, or whatever your heart desires.

HTTP Endpoint Support
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Target: Q2'17

StreamAlert will also support receiving data via an HTTP endpoint. This is for service providers or appliances that only support HTTP endpoints for logging. Example: Akamai

Historical Search
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Target: Q3/Q4'17

For historical searching, StreamAlert will use AWS Athena, a serverless, interactive query service that uses Presto to query data in S3. This will allow you to analyze data using SQL for both ad-hoc and scheduled queries.
