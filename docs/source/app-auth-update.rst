Updating an App's credentials
=============================

Overview
--------

You may need to change an App's credentials due to internal rotation policies or otherwise. The StreamAlert CLI allows you to easily update App credentials.
to aid in this process, the CLI also give you the ability to list currently configured Apps.

Listing Apps
------------

To list currently configured Apps (grouped by cluster), use the CLI command:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ python manage.py app list

Example output::

  Cluster: prod

    Name: duo_prod_collector
      log_level:                     info
      interval:                      rate(2 hours)
      timeout:                       80
      memory:                        128
      type:                          duo_auth


.. note:: The output will show `No Apps configured` if you haven't configured any Apps.


Updating App Credentials
----------------------------

To update an App's credentials, run the the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ python manage.py app update-auth --cluster <cluster> --name <app_name>


This will have you follow a process similar to `configuring a new App <app-configuration.html#example-prompts-for-duo-auth>`_.
