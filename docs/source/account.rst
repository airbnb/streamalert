Background
----------

StreamAlert can accept ingest, analyze and alert on data from a wide range of environments and operating systems.

However, the StreamAlert application itself, and its supporting services, must be deployed in an AWS account of your choosing. Deployment is automated via Terraform and can be done against an existing AWS account or a new isolated AWS account youâ€™ve created for this purpose.

Configuration
-------------
As outlined above, choose or create the AWS account you'll use to house the StreamAlert infrastructure.

If you're interested in demo'ing StreamAlert, you can create a hassle free-tier AWS account `here <https://aws.amazon.com/free/>`_.
