    Publish versions of the StreamAlert Lambda function.

    There are two environments, staging and production.  They are configured
    as Lambda alises, which are pointers to certain published versions
    of code.  Versions can be either: the most recently uploaded code,
    which is represented as $LATEST, or a published version (0, 1, 2, etc).

    Staging always points to $LATEST, and production always points to a
    published version.  These are both defined in `variables.json`.

    The goal of this class is to publish production Lambda versions.
